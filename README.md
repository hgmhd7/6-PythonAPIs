# Latitudinal Effects on Weather Patterns

In this prject, I pull API data from [openweathermap.org](https://openweathermap.org/api) to explore the effect that different latitudes have on weather patterns including humidity, wind speed, temperature, and cloudiness.  I do this by creating a randomized list of global city zipcodes generated my the CityPy package.
